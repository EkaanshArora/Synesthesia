# Synesthesia

Analyses image properties and it's pixel sequence values and correlates it to properties of music determining the scale, pitch, progression and pace of the music. All generated music is entirely generated from the image, has no random elements, and the results remain consistent. https://synesthesiaa.glitch.me/

This MIDI player was built using [MidiPlayerJS](https://github.com/grimmdude/MidiPlayerJS) to read the file, and [soundfont-player](https://github.com/danigb/soundfont-player) to load and play the sounds. Based on [MidiPlayerJS website](http://grimmdude.com/MidiPlayerJS/).
